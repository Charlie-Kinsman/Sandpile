The max variable increases or decreases the number of frames.
The l variable refers to the size of the sandpile boundaries.
Rot referes to the rate of trees, how many trees are added in a frame.
Br is the burn rate, how many fires to start in a frame.
Sig is the sigma of the Gaussian, affects the probability that neighbours will catch fire.
Burn time is the number of frames a given fire will last.
Currently it puts the sand in the middle rather than at random, insert x_i and y_i in the x[] array.
Have fun xoxoxo
